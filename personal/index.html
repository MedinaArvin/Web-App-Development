                <p><span id="me">I'm Arvin Garcia Medina </span>lived in Saplad, Minalin, Pampanga. I'm a student in La Verdad Christian College taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Information System. I have actually graduated on the course of Computer Programming last march 29, 2015. We are three siblings of Arnel Medina and Leonora Medina, we are Lei-vina, Aivan and I. I studied elementary here in Saplad, then I had transffered in Sto. Rosario High School when I'm in secondary level. Saplad, Minalin is a far place here in Pampanga that cannot afford to go by riding a land vehicle, the means of transportation here is by riding a motor boat unto the town. I think that is enough <em>thanks be to God</em>.</p>
